Step 5 : Our first service
---

A. Create our first service with angular-CLI

Create new folder in app/services/service1
Use shell command to go into app/services/service1
Use this command ng g service service1

NB : angular CLI use relative path, if you use this command in root folder you will create service1 in app.
